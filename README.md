# Gatsby + Wordpress Portfolio Site

```shell
npm install
```

üôè Pray

If your prayers go unanswered, you will probably have to change node versions, so hopefully you are already using nvm. Also you will probably have to manually install a variety of peer dependencies, for some reason...

## Once you have the correct version of node running, install (or re-install) gatsby-cli globally

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

## Don't forget

...to create .env.development and .env.production files, and make sure they reflect the correct info needed to connect to a given WordPress installation (and if developing locally, turn that server on!)
