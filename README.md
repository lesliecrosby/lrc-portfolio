## Setup
1. Install Gatsby CLI

Also create .env.development and .env.production files, and make sure they reflect the correct info needed to connect to a given WordPress installation (and if developing locally, turn that server on!)

3. Watch the magic âœ¨, and get to work!
```shell
gatsby develop
```
